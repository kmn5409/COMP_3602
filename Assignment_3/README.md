# LOLPARSER 

This lolparser should be compartible with the latest version of python and can be run using the command line if python is installed on your computer.
*Kindly add the LOLCODE code file to be tested to the same folder with the lolparser.py file for ease of access.*

## To run the lolparser.py file:

#### (Using the command line or terminal:)
First, navigate to the folder in which the `lolparser.py` and LOLCODE files are saved.  
Enter the following command:

      python lolparser.py
    
Press enter. 
When prompted, enter the name of the LOLCODE file to be tested with its `.lols` file extension:

      sample.lols
    
Press enter. 
	
#### (Using an IDE, like pycharm:)
	
Open the folder containing both the `lolparser.py` file and LOLCODE file to be tested. 

Ensure that the run configurations are set to run the `lolparser.py`

Click 'run'.

When prompted, enter the name of the LOLCODE file to be tested with its `.lols` file extension:

	sample.lols
  
Press enter. 
	

#### Possible errors:

1. If both the python file and lolcode file are not stored in the same folder,
    the program may not be able to find the file requested. 
    
2. This parser is only capabilty of handling code with simple syntax,
    if the code entered contains functions for example, it may not be correctly parsed.
